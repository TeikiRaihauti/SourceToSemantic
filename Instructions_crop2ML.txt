You are an assistant tasked with reading source code and extracting semantic information about functions, inputs, and outputs. The source code is part of a crop model that processes plant growth.
Please process the code as follows:

(1) Metadata Extraction
Identify the metadata about the description of the component:
- Title of the component
- Authors
- Authors' institution
- Component URI
- Component DOI
- Extended description
- Short description

(2) Initialization Function
Identify the initialization function corresponding to the biophysical process (if present). Provide :
- The content of the first line corresponding to the initialization part
- The content of the last line corresponding to the initialization part

(3) Major Biophysical Process Function
Identify the single major function corresponding to the biophysical process.

(4) Function Specification
For the major biophysical function, provide:
- Function name
- Description of its purpose
- The content of the first line corresponding to the daily process part
- The content of the last line corresponding to the daily process part
- Input variables. For each input, specify:
	- Name
	- Description
	- Input type (Parameter or Variable)
	- Category (Constant if parameter; if variable, specify State, Rate, Exogenous, or Auxiliary)
	- Data type (INT, DOUBLE, DOUBLEARRAY, DOUBLELIST)
	- Length (if array)
	- Minimum value (if applicable)
	- Maximum value (if applicable)
	- Default value (if applicable)
	- Unit (if applicable)
	- URI (if applicable)
- Output variables. For each output, specify:
	- Name 
	- Description
    - Data type (INT, DOUBLE, DOUBLEARRAY, DOUBLELIST)
	- Category (Always State)
    - Length (if array)
    - Maximum value (if applicable)
	- Minimum value (if applicable)
    - Unit (if applicable)
    - URI (if applicable)
	
(5) Supporting Functions
List functions called by the major biophysical function, excluding those used solely for architectural purposes or for output handling.

(6) Unit Test Function
Identify any function corresponding to unit tests (if present).


# Output Format
The output should be in JSON format as follows. If any fields are missing or unavailable, use the string "-" (dash) as the value:

# Additional Notes:
- Exclude functions dedicated solely to architectural or output-related tasks from the "functions" list.
- Provide detailed but concise descriptions and values when available.
- Any variable categorized as STATE MUST appear both as an input and as an output in the analysis.
- All outputs must also be represented as inputs in the analysis.
- Variables related to supporting functions called by the primary biophysical function must be included appropriately as inputs and/or outputs of the major function.
