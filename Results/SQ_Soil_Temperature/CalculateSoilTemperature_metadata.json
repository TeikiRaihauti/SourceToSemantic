        "Extended description": "Component of the SiriusQuality Soil Temperature module that computes daily minimum and maximum soil surface temperature and updates a deep soil layer temperature state. Inputs are air temperatures (min, mean, max), soil heat flux, and the current deep layer temperature; a parameter lambda_ (latent heat of vaporization, default 2.454 MJ kg-1) modulates the effect of soil heat flux. Two formulations are evaluated: SoilTempA uses weatherMaxTemp, mean air temperature (with a cold-season adjustment), and soil available energy (heatFlux * lambda_/1000) via an exponential response; SoilTempB averages weatherMinTemp with deepLayerT. Daily minTSoil is the minimum of A and B; maxTSoil is the maximum. The deep layer temperature is updated by an exponential smoothing: newDeepT = (9*oldDeepT + mean(minTSoil,maxTSoil))/10. Initialization sets deepLayerT to the annual mean air temperature. The module is part of a composite SoilTemperature strategy that can also generate hourly soil temperatures using the Parton & Logan (1981) approach with parameters a, b, c.",
