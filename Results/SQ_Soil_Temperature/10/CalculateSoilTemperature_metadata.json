        "Extended description": "Component for soil temperature within the SiriusQuality framework. It computes daily minimum and maximum soil temperature from air temperatures (min/mean/max) and soil heat flux using a latent heat parameter (lambda_), and updates the deep soil layer temperature with a running average. Optionally, it derives hourly soil surface temperature using the Parton and Logan (1981) diurnal model parameterized by a, b, and c and driven by day length. Inputs include weather and energy balance variables; outputs include min/max daily soil temperature, hourly soil temperature, and deep layer temperature.",
        "Short description": "Daily min/max soil temperature and optional hourly profile (Partonâ€“Logan) with deep layer temperature update.",
