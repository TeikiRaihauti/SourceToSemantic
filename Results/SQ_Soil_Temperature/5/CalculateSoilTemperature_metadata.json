        "Extended description": "Soil temperature component of SiriusQuality. It computes daily minimum and maximum soil temperature from air temperatures (min/mean/max) and soil heat flux, using an energy-based function (with latent heat of vaporization parameter λ and a cold adjustment below 8 °C) and a deep-layer coupling; the final min/max are the min/max of two estimates. The deep soil layer temperature is a state updated as an exponential moving average of daily mean soil temperature. Optionally, hourly soil surface temperature is generated using the Parton–Logan (1981) diurnal model parameterized by a, b, c and day length. Initialization sets deep-layer temperature from the annual mean air temperature; special missing/sentinel values (-999/999) are handled. Inputs include maxTAir, minTAir, meanTAir, meanAnnualAirTemp, dayLength, and heatFlux; outputs include minTSoil, maxTSoil, hourlySoilT, and deepLayerT.",
