        "Extended description": "SoilTemperature is a SiriusQuality component that computes soil temperature dynamics. It estimates daily minimum and maximum soil temperature from daily air temperatures (min, mean, max), soil heat flux, and a latent heat parameter (lambda_), while updating a deep soil layer temperature state with exponential smoothing initialized from the mean annual air temperature. Optionally, it derives hourly soil temperatures using the Parton & Logan (1981) diurnal model parameterized by a, b, and c and driven by day length. Inputs include meteorological variables and soil heat flux; outputs include daily min/max soil temperature, an hourly temperature profile, and an updated deep-layer temperature.",
        "Short description": "Component to compute daily min/max and hourly soil temperatures with deep-layer smoothing, including a Partonâ€“Logan diurnal scheme.",
