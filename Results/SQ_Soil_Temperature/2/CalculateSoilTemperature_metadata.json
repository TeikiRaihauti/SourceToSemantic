        "Extended description": "Computes soil temperature dynamics for crop simulations. It estimates daily minimum and maximum soil surface temperatures from air temperatures and soil heat flux, with a firstâ€‘order memory for deep soil temperature initialized from the annual mean air temperature. It can also produce hourly soil temperatures using the Parton & Logan (1981) diurnal formulation. Key parameters include lambda_ (latent heat of vaporization scaling) and a, b, c timing/shape coefficients; key states include maxTSoil, minTSoil, hourlySoilT, and deepLayerT.",
