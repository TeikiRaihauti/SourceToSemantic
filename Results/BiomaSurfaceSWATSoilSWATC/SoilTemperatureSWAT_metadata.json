        "Extended description": "Daily, multi-layer soil temperature model implementing the SWAT method (Neitsch et al., 2000). It computes a maximum damping depth as a function of bulk density, scales it by the total soil water content and soil profile depth to obtain an effective damping depth, and derives a depth factor for each layer center. Layer temperatures are updated using a first-order lag: T_i(t) = LagCoefficient * T_i(t-1) + (1 - LagCoefficient) * [DepthFactor * (T_air,annual - T_surface) + T_surface]. Inputs include soil profile depth, surface soil temperature (from a companion surface model), annual average air temperature, layer thickness, volumetric water content, and bulk density. Output is soil temperature by layers.",
