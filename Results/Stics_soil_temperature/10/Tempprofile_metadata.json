        "Extended description": "A daily soil temperature component that computes a 1 cm-resolution temperature profile using an exponentially damped propagation of canopy temperature signals, parameterized by thermal diffusivity and diurnal frequency. It derives temperature amplitude from canopy minimum and maximum, adjusts each depth with damping and relaxation terms using minimum air temperature, aggregates to user-defined layer means, and updates previous state profiles and canopy temperature.",
