        "Extended description": "Computes soil temperature profile (1 cm resolution) and layer-mean temperatures from canopy and air temperatures at each time step. The workflow: (1) compute canopy temperature amplitude from min/max canopy temperatures; (2) update the soil profile using an exponential damping derived from a fixed thermal diffusivity and diurnal frequency, coupled with previous canopy and soil temperatures; (3) aggregate to layer means; (4) update previous state (profile and canopy). An init routine sets the initial profile and canopy temperature to the day-1 mean air temperature.",
