        "Extended description": "Computes the daily soil temperature profile at 1 cm resolution using an exponentially damped response to canopyâ€“air thermal forcing, based on fixed thermal diffusivity (5.37e-3 m2 h-1) and diurnal frequency (7.272e-5 s-1 converted contextually). For each depth z, an attenuation factor vexp(z)=exp(-z*sqrt(temp_freq/(2*therm_diff))) is applied. The new profile blends: (i) persistence from the previous profile, (ii) an exponentially attenuated adjustment driven by the difference between previous canopy temperature and current minimum air temperature, (iii) a relaxation term toward the canopy temperature (weight 0.1), and (iv) half the current temperature amplitude scaled by the attenuation factor. Inputs: temperature amplitude, previous soil temperature profile, previous canopy temperature, and current minimum air temperature. Output: updated soil temperature profile.",
