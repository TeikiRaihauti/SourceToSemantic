        "Extended description": "Computes the daily soil temperature vertical profile at 1 cm resolution using the previous dayâ€™s profile, previous canopy temperature, current minimum air temperature, and the diurnal temperature amplitude. An exponential attenuation with depth is applied using a thermal diffusivity (5.37e-3 m2 s-1) and angular frequency (7.272e-5 s-1) to derive a decay factor vexp(z)=exp(-z*sqrt(temp_freq/(2*therm_diff))). The updated temperature combines: prior profile, an attenuated forcing term from canopy-air minimum difference, a relaxation term toward previous canopy temperature (0.1 factor), and half the attenuated diurnal amplitude. Auxiliary components compute temperature amplitude, canopy mean temperature, layer means, and update state variables.",
