        "Extended description": "This component simulates daily soil temperature. It computes canopy temperature amplitude from daily minimum and maximum canopy temperatures, propagates it through the soil profile at 1-cm resolution using exponential damping with depth and a relaxation toward canopy temperature, aggregates temperatures to user-defined soil layers, and updates previous state variables. Initialization sets the initial profile and canopy temperature from the first-day air temperature and layer thickness.",
        "Short description": "Daily soil temperature profile and layer means driven by canopy temperatures with state update.",
