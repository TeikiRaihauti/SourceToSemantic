        "Extended description": "This component computes daily soil temperature at 1 cm resolution and aggregates it to user-defined layers. It derives temperature amplitude from minimum and maximum canopy temperatures, updates the soil profile using an exponential damping with depth and the difference between previous canopy temperature and current minimum air temperature, and produces layer-mean temperatures from the profile and layer thicknesses. It also computes daily mean canopy temperature and updates previous state variables. An initialization routine sets the initial profile and canopy temperature from the first-day air temperature.",
