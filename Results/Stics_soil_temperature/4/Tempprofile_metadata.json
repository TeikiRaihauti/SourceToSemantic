        "Extended description": "Single-component soil temperature module combining submodels to compute daily soil thermal dynamics. It derives temperature amplitude from canopy min/max, computes canopy mean temperature, updates a 1-cm soil temperature profile using an exponentially damped diffusion approach (with fixed thermal diffusivity and diurnal frequency), averages the 1-cm profile to user-defined soil layers, and updates previous state variables for the next time step.",
