        "Extended description": "Computes daily soil temperature using canopy temperature amplitude and minimum air temperature. The core routine updates a 1 cm-resolution soil temperature profile via an exponentially damped signal derived from fixed thermal diffusivity and diurnal frequency, with relaxation toward canopy temperature. The profile is aggregated to user-defined soil layers, and previous state variables (profile and canopy temperature) are updated for the next step. An initialization sets the initial profile and canopy temperature to the first-day mean air temperature.",
