        "Extended description": "Single-component soil temperature model computing a daily temperature profile at 1 cm resolution and mean temperature per user-defined layers. It derives the canopy temperature amplitude from daily min/max canopy temperatures, then updates each depth using an exponentially damped signal (based on fixed thermal diffusivity and diurnal frequency), a relaxation toward canopy temperature, and the effect of minimum air temperature; it also computes canopy mean temperature and updates previous state variables. Initialization sets the soil profile and canopy temperature to the first-day air temperature.",
