        "Extended description": "STICS-based soil temperature component that computes a daily 1 cm-resolution soil temperature profile and layer-averaged temperatures. The model derives canopy temperature amplitude (max − min) and mean, then updates each depth using an exponentially damped signal with a thermal damping coefficient computed as sqrt(temp_freq/(2*therm_diff)) where temp_freq = 7.272e-5 and therm_diff = 5.37e-3. For depth index z, vexp(z) = exp(−z*therm_amp) and the profile update is: T(z) = T_prev(z) − vexp(z)*(T_canopy_prev − Tmin_air) + 0.1*(T_canopy_prev − T_prev(z)) + 0.5*temp_amp*vexp(z). Layer means are computed by averaging 1 cm values within each user-defined layer thickness. Initialization sets the profile (length equal to sum of layer thicknesses) and canopy temperature to the first-day air temperature. The component aggregates sub-models: temp_amp, canopy_temp_avg, temp_profile, layers_temp, and update.",
