        "Extended description": "Computes daily soil temperature by layers using the SWAT 2000 damping‑depth approach. The method blends previous-day layer temperatures with a lag coefficient and updates each layer’s temperature using depth-dependent damping derived from soil bulk density, volumetric water content, total profile water, and layer thickness. The depth factor scales the difference between annual mean air temperature and surface soil temperature.
