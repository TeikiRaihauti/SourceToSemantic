        "Extended description": "Calculates soil temperature by layers using the SWAT method (Neitsch et al., 2000). Each layer’s temperature is updated with a lagged combination of its prior value and an equilibrium temperature derived from annual average air temperature and current surface soil temperature. The approach computes a depth-dependent damping depth using soil profile depth, bulk density, layer thickness, and volumetric water content.",
