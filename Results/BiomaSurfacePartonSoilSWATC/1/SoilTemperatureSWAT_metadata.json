        "Extended description": "Strategy for the calculation of soil temperature by layers using the SWAT method (Neitsch et al., 2000). It applies a lag coefficient and a depth-damping function driven by annual average air temperature and surface soil temperature; damping depth depends on bulk density, soil water content, layer thickness and soil profile depth.",
