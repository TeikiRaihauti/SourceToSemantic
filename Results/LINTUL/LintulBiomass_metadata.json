        "Extended description": "LintulBiomass calculates daily crop biomass production and leaf area index (LAI) in the SIMPLACE framework using LINTUL concepts. Intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is computed from global radiation and LAI via an extinction coefficient. Daily total biomass growth equals PAR times a crop-specific light-use efficiency (LUE), reduced by the most limiting stress (water via TRANRF or nitrogen via an LUE reduction function of the nitrogen nutrition index, NNI). Biomass is partitioned to roots, stems, leaves, and storage organs using development-stage dependent fractions. Leaf senescence combines development-, shading-, water- and heat-stress-related relative death rates, with additional N-stress impacts. LAI growth is derived from leaf biomass via specific leaf area (SLA), reduced under N stress; at early development LAI follows an exponential relative growth rate constrained by water and N stress. Outputs include daily total biomass increment (GTOTAL), intercepted PAR, and above-ground biomass.",
