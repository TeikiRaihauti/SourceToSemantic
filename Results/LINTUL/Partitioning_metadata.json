        "Extended description": "Partitioning computes daily biomass allocation fractions to roots, leaves, stems, and storage organs within the SIMPLACE implementation of the LINTUL crop model. Baseline fractions are read from user-defined DVS-based partitioning tables (roots, leaves, stems, storage organs). On each day, the component modifies these fractions according to the dominant stress: (1) Drought stress (if TRANRF < NitrogenNutritionIndex) increases the root fraction by a factor FRTMOD = max(1, 1/(TRANRF + 0.5)) and proportionally reduces shoot fractions so that all fractions sum to 1; (2) Nitrogen stress reduces the leaf fraction by FLVMOD = exp(-PartitionNStressReduction * (1 - NitrogenNutritionIndex)), reallocating the difference to stems, while roots and storage organ fractions follow their tables. This component implements the LINTUL-2 partitioning logic following van Oijen and Leffelaar (2008).",
