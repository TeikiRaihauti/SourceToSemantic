        "Extended description": "DayLength is a SIMPLACE component that computes photoperiod (day length) in minutes for a given latitude and day of year. On initialization it precomputes an integer array of day lengths for days 1–369 using trigonometric relations between latitude and solar declination. Solar declination is approximated as sin(dec) = −sin(23.45°) · cos(2π · (day+10)/365). For each day, the hour-based photoperiod is calculated as t = 12 · [1 + (2/π) · asin((sin(lat)·sin(dec)) / (cos(lat)·cos(dec)))], bounded in [−1,1] for numerical stability, then converted to minutes and rounded. During processing, the component returns the precomputed value for the current day of year. Inputs: cLatitude (degrees), iDayOfYear (1–366). Output: DayLength (minutes).",
