        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature by layer using a seasonal cosine forcing around the annual mean soil temperature and a depth-dependent damping term. Damping depth is a function of bulk density and soil water, with albedo and water content affecting heat flux. The module updates a 5â€‘day moving average of soil temperature, surface temperature, and the profile temperatures at each layer midpoint.",
