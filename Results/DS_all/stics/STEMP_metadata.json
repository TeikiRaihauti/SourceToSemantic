        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature by layer using a sinusoidal annual forcing around an average annual soil temperature (TAV) with amplitude (TAMP). Thermal damping depth depends on bulk density and soil water status, and a 5â€‘day moving average of recent temperatures adjusts the surface forcing. The module provides surface temperature and soil temperatures at the midpoint of each soil layer.",
