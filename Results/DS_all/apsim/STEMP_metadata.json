        "Extended description": "STEMP is the DSSAT soil temperature module that computes daily soil temperature by soil layer using a damped cosine function of day-of-year around a mean annual temperature. Damping depth and profile are influenced by bulk density, soil water, and albedo; the module also maintains a 5-day moving average and provides surface litter temperature and layer midpoint temperatures.",
