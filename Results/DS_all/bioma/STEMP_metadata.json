        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature at the surface and by layer using a damped sinusoidal formulation driven by mean annual temperature (TAV), annual amplitude (TAMP), day of year and hemispheric phase (HDAY). Damping depth (DP) is derived from bulk density and soil water effects (FX, WW), with instantaneous water supply (PESW) controlled by ISWWAT. The model updates a 5-day moving average of surface temperature (TMA) to derive a temperature offset (DT), then calculates layer temperatures (ST) as a depth-attenuated cosine wave (exp(ZD)) and returns surface temperature (SRFTEMP), cumulative depth and mid-layer depths (CUMDPT, DSMID), and totals at drained upper limit (TDL). This C# implementation is a port of the EPIC/DSSAT soil temperature routine.",
