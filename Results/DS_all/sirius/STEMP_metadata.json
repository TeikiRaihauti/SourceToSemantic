        "Extended description": "STEMP is a soil temperature component originating from the DSSAT suite. This C# implementation (SiriusQualitySTEMP_) computes daily soil temperature profiles by combining sinusoidal seasonal forcing (using average annual soil temperature TAV, amplitude TAMP, day of year DOY, and hemisphere-dependent phase HDAY) with damping controlled by soil bulk density (BD), water content (SW, DUL, LL), and profile depth. It maintains a 5-day moving array of mean temperatures (TMA), updates surface temperature (SRFTEMP), layer midpoints (DSMID), cumulative depth (CUMDPT), and layer temperatures (ST). Key parameters include NL, NLAYR, DS, DLAYR, MSALB, XLAT, and a water control switch (ISWWAT). The core routine SOILT computes depth-dependent temperature using an exponential decay from the surface sinusoid modulated by water content and density-derived damping depth.",
