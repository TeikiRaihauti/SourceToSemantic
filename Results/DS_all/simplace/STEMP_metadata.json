        "Extended description": "Java implementation of the DSSAT STEMP soil temperature routine as a Simplace FWSimComponent. It initializes soil profile depths and midpoints, aggregates soil water variables at drained upper limit and lower limit, and computes an effective thermal damping depth as a function of bulk density and soil water. The module maintains a 5â€‘day running average of surface temperature (TMA/ATOT) influenced by albedo and radiation, applies a hemispheric phase shift (HDAY=200 for northern, 20 for southern hemisphere), and then calculates surface litter temperature (SRFTEMP) and the temperature in each soil layer (ST) using a damped cosine function of day of year. Key inputs: soil layer properties (BD, DLAYR, DS, DUL, LL), soil water (SW), site/weather (TAVG, TMAX, SRAD, XLAT), and annual temperature parameters (TAV, TAMP, MSALB). Key outputs: CUMDPT, DSMID, TDL, TMA, ATOT, SRFTEMP, and ST.",
