        "Extended description": "SIMPLACE component that simulates daily soil temperature by layer using the APEX/EPIC STMP formulation. Temperatures are updated with a lag coefficient (LAG=0.8) and a depth factor based on a damping depth computed from bulk density (ABD) and profile water content. The profile is initialized between the first-day mean air temperature and the longâ€‘term mean air temperature (AVT), extending layers to the damping depth if needed. The model updates both temperatures and daily change rates. Surface temperature is supplied as input and can be produced by the companion SnowCoverCalculator, which accounts for residue and snow cover effects.",
