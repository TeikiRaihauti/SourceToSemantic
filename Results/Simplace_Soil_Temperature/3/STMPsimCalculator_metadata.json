        "Extended description": "A SIMPLACE component that simulates daily soil temperature profiles across multiple layers using the APEX-based STMP approach. The model updates each layer’s temperature with a lagged formulation: current temperature is a weighted mix of yesterday’s temperature and a depth-scaled target driven by soil surface temperature (DST0) and the deep-layer constant temperature (AVT). The depth attenuation factor depends on the ratio of layer mid-depth to a dynamically computed damping depth (DD), which varies with bulk density (ABD) and total soil water content. Initialization builds a linear temperature profile between the first-day mean air temperature and AVT down to the specified damping depth. Soil surface temperature can be provided directly or computed via the companion SnowCoverCalculator using air temperature, radiation, residue/snow effects, and snow dynamics.",
