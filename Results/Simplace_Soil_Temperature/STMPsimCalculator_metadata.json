        "Extended description": "STMPsimCalculator is a SIMPLACE component that simulates daily soil temperature in multiple layers following the APEX STMP approach (Williams & Izaurralde, 2005). The model updates soil temperature as STMP = LAG*STMP0 + (1−LAG)*(FZ*(AVT−DST0)+DST0), with a default lag LAG=0.8. Depth effect FZ depends on layer mid-depth and the damping depth (DD). DD is computed from average bulk density (ABD) and soil water content (WC) via DP = 1 + 2.5*ABD/(ABD + exp(6.53−5.63*ABD)), WC = 0.001*ST/(Z(n)*(0.356−0.144*ABD)), and DD = exp(ln(0.5/DP)*((1−WC)/(1+WC))*2)*DP. Bare surface temperature DST is estimated from daily air temperature and radiation, while the effective surface temperature DST0 (used to drive the profile) is provided by the coupled SnowCoverCalculator component to account for residue and snow cover. Initialization linearly interpolates between the first-day mean air temperature and the deep-layer average temperature (AVT) and extends layers to the damping depth if needed. State outputs are the soil temperature profile (SoilTempArray) and daily changes (rSoilTempArrayRate). Licensed under GNU LGPL v3. Reference: Williams, J.R., Izaurralde, C.A. (2005).
