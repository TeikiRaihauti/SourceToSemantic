        "Extended description": "STMPsimCalculator is a SIMPLACE component that simulates daily soil temperature by layer using the APEX-based STMP formulation. It updates each layer’s temperature via a lagged combination of the previous day and a depth-weighted approach: STMP = LAG * STMP0 + (1−LAG) * (FZ * (AVT − DST0) + DST0), where FZ depends on layer midpoint depth relative to a dynamically computed damping depth (DD). DD is estimated from average soil bulk density (ABD) and soil water content, following APEX equations. The surface temperature (DST0) is provided by the coupled SnowCoverCalculator, which accounts for residue/snow insulation. Initialization linearly interpolates temperatures from a first-day mean air temperature at the surface to the long-term average air temperature (AVT) at the damping depth, adding virtual layers down to DD.
