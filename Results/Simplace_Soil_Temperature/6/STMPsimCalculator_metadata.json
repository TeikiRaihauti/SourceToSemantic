        "Extended description": "Implements the APEX STMP routine to compute daily soil temperatures for multiple layers using a lagged update toward the long-term mean air temperature (AVT) and a depth factor controlled by damping depth (function of bulk density and soil water). Initializes temperatures linearly between first-day mean air temperature and AVT down to the damping depth. Requires soil surface temperature (DST0), typically provided by the companion SnowCoverCalculator that accounts for residue/snow cover. Outputs per-layer temperatures and daily change rates; supports re-initialization.",
