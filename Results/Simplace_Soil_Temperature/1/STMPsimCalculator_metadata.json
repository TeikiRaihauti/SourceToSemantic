        "Extended description": "STMPsimCalculator is a SIMPLACE component that simulates daily soil temperature in multiple layers using the STMP formulation from the APEX/EPIC family of models. Each layer temperature is updated by a lagged mix of the previous day's temperature and a surface-driven term. The weighting factor depends on dimensionless depth (relative to a dynamically computed damping depth). Damping depth is a function of bulk density and soil water content, and the surface temperature is derived from daily air temperatures and radiation and then adjusted for residue and snow cover via the SnowCoverCalculator component. Key relations implemented include: DP = 1 + (2.5·ABD)/(ABD + exp(6.53 − 5.63·ABD)); DD = exp(ln(0.5/DP)·((1 − WC)/(1 + WC))·2)·DP with WC = 0.001·ST/(Z(n)·(0.356 − 0.144·ABD)); a depth-response FZ = ZD/(ZD + exp(−0.8669 − 2.0775·ZD)); and a surface temperature estimate DST from daily mean, amplitude, and net radiation. The final surface temperature DST0 is blended with the prior day’s temperature in the upper soil through a cover-dependent lag (BCV) computed in SnowCoverCalculator. Inputs include soil layer depths, average ground temperature (AVT), bulk density (ABD), damping depth, total soil water content, and soil surface temperature; outputs include an array of soil temperatures and their daily rates. The component is LGPL-3.0 licensed within the SIMPLACE framework.
