        "Extended description": "This SIMPLACE component simulates daily soil temperature profiles (STMP) across multiple soil layers using APEX-based formulations. Soil temperature is updated by lagging the previous dayâ€™s temperature and blending the soil surface temperature with a depth-dependent attenuation controlled by a dynamic damping depth that depends on bulk density and soil water content. The soil surface temperature is computed from daily air temperature extremes, global radiation, and albedo; when coupled with the SnowCoverCalculator, residue and snow cover modify the surface temperature via a cover-dependent lag factor, and snow dynamics (accumulation, melt, and evaporation) are simulated. The configuration (soiltemp.xml) links SnowCoverCalculator outputs (SoilSurfaceTemperature) to STMPsimCalculator, producing a coherent soil temperature profile for use in nutrient and hydrologic submodels.",
