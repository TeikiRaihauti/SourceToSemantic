        "Extended description": "SIMPLACE component that computes daily soil temperature (STMP) for multiple soil layers using the EPIC/APEX formulation. Layer temperatures are updated via a lag toward the soil surface temperature and the long-term average air temperature, with a depth factor based on damping depth. The damping depth depends on bulk density and soil water content; initialization extends the profile to the damping depth and linearly interpolates between the first-day mean air temperature and AVT. The soil surface temperature is typically provided by the SnowCoverCalculator, which accounts for radiation, albedo, crop residues, and snow cover.
