        "Extended description": "Simulates daily soil temperature at the center of multiple soil layers using the APEX STMP formulation. Damping depth is computed from bulk density and soil water content, and temperatures relax from the soil surface toward the long-term mean air temperature with a lag term. Initialization linearly interpolates between the first-day mean air temperature and AVT across the specified damping depth; the component expects a soil-surface temperature input (e.g., from SnowCoverCalculator) and outputs the multilayer soil temperature profile and daily change rates.",
