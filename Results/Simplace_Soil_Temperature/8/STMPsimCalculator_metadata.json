        "Extended description": "Implements the APEX/STMP approach to simulate daily soil temperature across multiple soil layers, with optional coupling to a snow/residue surface module. Initialization extends layer depths to the damping depth and linearly interpolates temperatures between the first-day mean air temperature and the deep-layer average (AVT). Each day, temperatures are updated with a lagged scheme (LAG=0.8) using a depth factor relative to the damping depth (DD), where DD depends on bulk density and soil water content. The companion SnowCoverCalculator estimates soil surface temperature and snow dynamics (accumulation, melt, evaporation) via residue/snow isolation indices, providing the surface temperature input to STMP. Inputs include layer depths, AVT, bulk density, soil water content, meteorology, and surface temperature; outputs are per-layer soil temperatures and their daily changes.",
