        "Extended description": "STMPsimCalculator computes daily soil temperature in multiple soil layers following the APEX STMP formulation (Williams & Izaurralde, 2005). Initialization extends the soil profile down to the damping depth and linearly interpolates temperatures from the first-day mean air temperature at the surface to the long-term mean air temperature (AVT) at depth. Each day, layer temperatures are updated with a lag (LAG=0.8) toward a depth-weighted combination of the current soil surface temperature (DST0) and AVT. The damping depth (DD) varies with average bulk density (ABD) and current profile water content (ST). Inputs include layer depths, first-day mean air temperature, AVT, ABD, initial damping depth, profile water content, and soil surface temperature (often provided by SnowCoverCalculator). Outputs are the layer-wise soil temperature array and its daily change; an extended layer-depth array is also maintained. Designed for use within the SIMPLACE framework.",
