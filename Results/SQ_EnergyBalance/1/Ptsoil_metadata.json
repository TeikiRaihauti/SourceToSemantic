        "Extended description": "Implements the energy-limited stage of soil evaporation using a Priestley–Taylor-based formulation modulated by plant cover. Given evapoTranspirationPriestlyTaylor (ET_PT) and parameters Alpha (Priestley–Taylor coefficient), tau (plant cover factor), and tauAlpha (threshold fraction of net radiation at the soil surface when AlphaE = 1), the effective coefficient AlphaE is: if tau < tauAlpha, AlphaE = 1; else AlphaE = Alpha - ((Alpha - 1) * (1 - tau) / (1 - tauAlpha)). The energy-limited soil evaporation is then computed as energyLimitedEvaporation = (ET_PT / Alpha) * AlphaE * tau.",
