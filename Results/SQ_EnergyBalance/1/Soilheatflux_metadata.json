        "Extended description": "SoilHeatFlux is an EnergyBalance sub-model (in the SiriusQuality2 lineage) that computes the soil heat flux as the fraction of net radiation available at the soil surface minus soil evaporation. It uses a plant cover factor (tau) to partition the net radiation equivalent evaporation between canopy and soil. Required inputs: netRadiationEquivalentEvaporation and soilEvaporation (both in g m-2 d-1). Output: soilHeatFlux (g m-2 d-1). Core equation: soilHeatFlux = tau * netRadiationEquivalentEvaporation - soilEvaporation. Parameter: tau (plant cover factor), default 0.9983.",
        "Short description": "Computes available energy in the soil as tau times net radiation equivalent evaporation minus soil evaporation.",
