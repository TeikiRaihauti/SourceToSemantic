        "Extended description": "This component computes soil evaporation during the diffusion-limited stage as a function of the water deficit in the top soil layers and a soil diffusion constant. Given the auxiliary input deficitOnTopLayers (scaled by 1/1000) and parameter soilDiffusionConstant (default 4.2), the daily diffusion-limited evaporation (g m-2 d-1) is: if deficit ≤ 0 mm, 8300; else if 0 < deficit < 25 mm, 2·D²/deficit·1000; otherwise 0. The result is assigned to diffusionLimitedEvaporation in the state. Units in code are consistent with g m-2 d-1 for flux and mm for deficit after scaling.",
