        "Extended description": "This component computes potential transpiration as a fixed fraction of the daily evapotranspiration using a plant cover factor (tau). It reads evapoTranspiration from EnergyBalanceRate and sets potentialTranspiration = evapoTranspiration * (1 − tau), where tau ∈ [0,1] (default 0.9983). The strategy follows the SiriusQuality2 energy-balance formulation within the CRA.ModelLayer framework.",
