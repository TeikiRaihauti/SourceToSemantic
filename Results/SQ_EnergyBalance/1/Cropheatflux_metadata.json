        "Extended description": "CropHeatFlux is an EnergyBalance component that computes the canopy (crop) heat flux as the residual of available net radiation after accounting for soil heat flux and potential transpiration. Using netRadiationEquivalentEvaporation (from net radiation scaled by latent heat), the instantaneous soilHeatFlux, and potentialTranspiration, it applies: cropHeatFlux = netRadiationEquivalentEvaporation − soilHeatFlux − potentialTranspiration. Inputs and outputs are expressed in mass/area/time energy-equivalent units consistent with the surrounding EnergyBalance module.",
        "Short description": "Computes crop heat flux as net radiation equivalent evaporation minus soil heat flux and potential transpiration.",
