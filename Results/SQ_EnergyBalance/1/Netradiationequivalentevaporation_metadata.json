        "Extended description": "This EnergyBalance component computes the net radiation expressed as an equivalent evaporation rate by dividing net radiation at the canopy surface by the latent heat of vaporization of water (lambdaV) and converting to mass flux (Ã—1000). It is used downstream to drive evapotranspiration and heat flux calculations within the SiriusQuality2-style energy balance chain.",
