        "Extended description": "Daily soil temperature component that computes surface and layer temperatures using an EPIC/Parton–Logan seasonal cosine function with latitude-dependent phase, soil albedo (including mulch effects), and a damping depth derived from bulk density and water content. The routine maintains a 5‑day moving average of air temperature to adjust the temperature profile and uses potential extractable soil water to modulate attenuation through the profile.",
