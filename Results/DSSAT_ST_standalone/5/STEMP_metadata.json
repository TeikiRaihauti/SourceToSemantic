        "Extended description": "Computes daily soil temperature for each soil layer using annual mean soil temperature (TAV), temperature amplitude (TAMP), solar radiation, soil albedo (including mulch and soil-water effects), bulk density, and water content to derive damping depth and propagate a sinusoidal temperature wave following EPIC/Parton–Logan concepts. Also estimates a surface litter temperature and provides seasonal initialization and daily updates within DSSAT.",
