        "Extended description": "Implements the DSSAT soil temperature module (STEMP). Computes daily soil temperatures by layer and the soil surface using weather inputs (TAVG, TMAX, SRAD), average annual temperature (TAV), temperature amplitude (TAMP), latitude-based phase (HDAY), and soil properties (bulk density, layer depths, albedo, water content). Uses an EPIC-based damping depth formulation with corrected water content, maintains a 5â€‘day moving average of soil temperatures, and outputs layer temperatures (ST) and surface temperature (SRFTEMP).",
