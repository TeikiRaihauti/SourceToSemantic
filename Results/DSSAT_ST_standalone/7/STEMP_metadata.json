        "Extended description": "Daily soil temperature component that computes surface and layer temperatures using a sinusoidal forcing based on annual mean (TAV) and amplitude (TAMP), with damping depth derived from soil bulk density, albedo, and water content (via potential extractable soil water). The formulation follows the Partonâ€“Logan approach, adjusts for hemisphere-specific hottest day, and can operate with or without dynamic soil water (ISWWAT). Outputs include surface temperature and temperatures by soil layer.",
