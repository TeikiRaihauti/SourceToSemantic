        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature profiles by layer using the Parton-Logan approach with a corrected soil water term. It uses weather inputs (solar radiation, average and maximum air temperature, latitude), long-term temperature statistics (TAV, TAMP), and soil properties (albedo with mulch effects, bulk density, layer depths, water contents) to update a 5-day moving average and estimate surface and layer temperatures.",
        "Short description": "Determines soil temperature by layer.",
