        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature by layer for the DSSAT crop modeling system using EPIC-derived harmonic formulations. It updates a 5-day moving average of mean air temperature and uses long-term mean temperature (TAV) and amplitude (TAMP) to drive a sinusoidal annual signal shifted by the climatological hottest day (HDAY). Damping depth (DP) is a function of bulk density (ABD) and a moisture-dependent factor (FX), with the water content ratio WC = max(0.01, PESW)/(WW*CUMDPT)*10 influencing thermal damping. Layer temperatures are calculated at layer midpoints (DSMID) as a decaying cosine with depth, and a surface litter temperature (SRFTEMP) is also provided. The routine accounts for soil albedo (including mulch effects) and distinguishes whether soil water is simulated (ISWWAT). It is adapted from EPIC soil temperature routines and is widely used across DSSAT components.",
