        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature by layer within the DSSAT framework using EPIC-based formulations. It estimates a damping depth (DD) from bulk density and a water-content function (WC) based on potential extractable soil water, then applies a sinusoidal annual forcing with latitude-dependent phase (HDAY) to calculate temperatures at layer midpoints: T(z) = TAV + (TAMP/2·cos(ALX+ZD) + DT)·exp(ZD), where ZD = −depth/DD. The module maintains a 5-day moving average of air temperature (TMA) to compute the departure term (DT) and also provides a surface temperature (SRFTEMP). Seasonal initialization spins up the profile and sets albedo from mulch/soil albedo (MSALB).",
