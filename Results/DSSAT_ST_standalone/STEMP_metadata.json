        "Extended description": "STEMP computes daily soil temperature by layer within DSSAT/CSM using EPIC-inspired damping-depth physics and a sinusoidal seasonal forcing. It initializes layer midpoints and cumulative depth, derives bulk density and an effective water content function WC = max(0.01, PESW)/(WW*CUMDPT)*10, computes a damping depth DD = FX*DP with FX = exp(B*((1−WC)/(1+WC))^2), and updates temperatures as ST(L) = TAV + (TAMP/2*cos(ALX + ZD) + DT)*exp(ZD), where ALX is the seasonal phase, ZD = −DSMID(L)/DD, DT is the deviation of recent mean air temperature from the seasonal signal, and TAV/TAMP are long-term mean and amplitude. Surface temperature is calculated similarly. Inputs include radiation, air temperatures, latitude, soil water (or DUL if water is off), albedo (including mulch), and soil properties by layer. Output is daily surface and layer temperatures.",
