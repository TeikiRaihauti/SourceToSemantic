        "Extended description": "Computes daily soil temperature by layer (ST) and surface temperature (SRFTEMP) using an EPIC/Partonâ€“Logan-based approach. Initializes layer depths and a 5-day moving average, derives damping depth from bulk density and soil water, applies albedo (including mulch/soil moisture effects), and updates temperatures with weather (TAVG, TMAX, SRAD), latitude, and climatology (TAV, TAMP). Designed for DSSAT and optionally couples to soil water status (ISWWAT).",
