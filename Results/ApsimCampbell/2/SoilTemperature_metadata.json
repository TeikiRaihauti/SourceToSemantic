        "Extended description": "Simulates one-dimensional soil heat flow and temperature over a soil profile, including the soil surface. The component computes volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity from soil physical properties (bulk density, texture, organic matter, rock content), soil water content, and soil roughness. It solves the heat diffusion equation using a finite-difference, tri-diagonal (Thomas) algorithm with sub-daily timesteps, and couples to the atmosphere via a boundary layer conductance (with stability corrections) and net radiation (shortwave and longwave) calculations. It supports initialisation from a seasonal sinusoidal profile, uses phantom nodes at depth to enforce a lower boundary, and outputs sub-daily and daily min/mean/max soil temperatures. Formulations are largely based on Campbell (1985) Soil physics with BASIC: Transport models for soil-plant systems.",
