        "Extended description": "A 1D soil heat flow and temperature profile component which simulates temperatures from the air node through the soil surface and into layered soil using Campbell (1985) physics. The soil is represented by nodes (air, surface, one per layer, plus phantom nodes below the profile) and solved with a Thomas tridiagonal algorithm for transient heat conduction. Volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity are estimated from soil constituents (rocks, organic matter, sand, silt, clay, water, air) and soil water, then mapped from layers to nodes. The model couples to the atmosphere via a stability-corrected boundary layer conductance and net radiation (short- and long-wave) computed from weather and canopy/residue effects. It runs with sub-daily iterations (default 48 per day), supports initial layer temperatures, and reports daily minimum, maximum, average, and final soil and surface temperatures.",
