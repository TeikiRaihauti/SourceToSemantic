        "Extended description": "The soil temperature model simulates the heat flux and temperatures over the soil profile, including the temperature on the soil surface. The model is based on processes described in Campbell, G.S. (1985) 'Soil physics with BASIC: Transport models for soil-plant systems'. The model includes functionality for simulating the heat flux and temperatures over the soil profile. It uses a geometric progression for element lengths to achieve the best simulation results. The model is designed to work with short elements near the soil surface and longer ones deeper in the soil.",
