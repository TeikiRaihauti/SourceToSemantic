        "Extended description": "APSIMâ€™s SoilTemperature component simulates sub-daily heat fluxes and temperatures from the soil surface through the soil profile. It represents the profile using nodes (including an atmospheric node, a surface node, layer-centre nodes, and several phantom nodes below the profile) and solves the 1-D heat diffusion using a tri-diagonal (Thomas) algorithm with a configurable differencing coefficient (nu). Thermal properties are computed from soil constituents (minerals, organic matter, water, air, etc.) and soil state (water content, bulk density), drawing on formulations largely based on Campbell (1985). The model iterates through intra-day time steps (default 48 per day), computes net radiation (short- and long-wave) and an atmospheric boundary layer conductance with stability corrections, and updates surface and layer temperatures along with daily min/avg/max diagnostics. It links to APSIM weather, soil physical, organic matter, and soil water components (including albedo, evaporation, and canopy height from MicroClimate/SoilWater). References: Campbell, G.S. (1985) Soil Physics with BASIC.
