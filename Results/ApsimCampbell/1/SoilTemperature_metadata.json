        "Extended description": "A soil heat transfer component in APSIM Next Generation which simulates sub-daily heat fluxes and temperatures from the air node through the soil surface into the profile. It represents the soil as nodes (air=0, surface=1, layer centres=2..N) and uses a tri-diagonal solver (Thomas algorithm) with a Crank–Nicholson-type weighting to step temperatures. Thermal properties (volumetric heat capacity and conductivity) are derived from layer composition (rocks, organic matter, sand, silt, clay, water, air) following formulations based on Campbell (1985). Upper boundary conditions include sensible, latent and net radiative fluxes; atmospheric boundary layer conductance is computed using Monin–Obukhov stability functions and wind, canopy height and instrument height. Net radiation is partitioned into shortwave and longwave components with cloud and vapour effects. The model iterates sub-daily (default 48 steps) to produce daily minimum, maximum and average soil temperatures, and integrates with APSIM weather, microclimate and soil water/physical modules.",
