        "Extended description": "One-dimensional soil temperature component which represents the soil profile as layers with temperature nodes from the atmosphere through the soil, plus phantom nodes below the profile to a constant-temperature depth. It simulates transient heat conduction with sub-daily time steps (default 48 per day) using a tri-diagonal solver (Thomas algorithm) and a weighted implicit scheme (nu=0.6). Thermal properties are derived from soil physical characteristics (thickness, bulk density, texture, rocks, organic matter) and water content, while atmospheric boundary-layer conductance and net radiation (shortwave and longwave) are calculated from weather inputs (air temperature, radiation, wind, pressure). The model provides daily minimum, maximum, and average soil temperatures by layer and at the surface, as well as thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, heat storage, and boundary-layer conductance, drawing on methods from Campbell (1985).",
