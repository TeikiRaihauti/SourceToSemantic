        "Extended description": "A C# soil temperature component which simulates soil surface and profile temperatures by solving 1-D heat conduction with energy balance terms following Campbell (1985). The soil is discretised into nodes (air, surface, one per layer, plus phantom nodes below). Sub-daily iterations (default 48 per day) solve a tridiagonal system (Thomas algorithm) using net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and an atmospheric boundary layer conductance (calculated or constant). Thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity are derived from soil properties (bulk density, texture, rocks, carbon) and water content. Inputs come from weather (temperature, radiation, wind, pressure) and soil water/canopy states; outputs include daily min/mean/max soil temperatures, surface temperature, and profiles of heat capacity and thermal conductivity.",
