        "Extended description": "A one-dimensional soil temperature component that simulates heat flux and temperatures across a layered soil profile, including an air node, surface node, layer-center nodes, and phantom nodes below the profile. Thermal properties (volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity) are derived from soil composition and water content; the heat diffusion equation is solved using a tri-diagonal Thomas algorithm with a configurable Crankâ€“Nicolson weighting. The model calculates atmospheric boundary layer conductance (or uses a constant), shortwave and longwave net radiation, and includes latent heat via evaporation. It requires weather, soil physical and organic properties, and soil water inputs, and provides daily minimum, maximum, and average soil temperatures as outputs. Methods and parameters are largely based on Campbell (1985) Soil physics with BASIC: Transport models for soil-plant systems.",
