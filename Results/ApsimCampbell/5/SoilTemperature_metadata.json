        "Extended description": "Simulates soil temperature dynamics across the profile, including the surface, using sub-daily heat flux calculations. Implements Campbell (1985) formulations for volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity, solves the tri-diagonal heat diffusion system via the Thomas algorithm, and calculates atmospheric boundary layer conductance with radiative and stability corrections. Uses weather, soil physical/organic properties, and soil water inputs; outputs include min/max/average soil and surface temperatures and thermal properties.",
