        "Extended description": "Simulates soil temperature over a 1-D profile including the surface and several phantom nodes below the profile. The approach follows Campbell (1985): layers are mapped to temperature nodes, volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity are derived from soil constituents and water content, and heat flow is solved each sub-daily timestep with an implicit tri-diagonal (Thomas) algorithm using a nu weighting (Crankâ€“Nicholson-like) scheme. The surface energy balance includes net shortwave/longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat, with optional calculation of atmospheric boundary-layer conductance using wind, canopy height, and stability corrections. Air temperature and net radiation are interpolated intra-day from daily weather. The component integrates with APSIM weather, soil physical, organic matter, and soil water modules.",
