        "Extended description": "Layered 1-D soil temperature component based on Campbell (1985). The soil is represented by nodes at the air (0), surface (1), layer centres (2..N), and several phantom nodes below the profile to enforce a constant-temperature lower boundary. At sub-daily steps it computes net radiation, atmospheric boundary-layer conductance (stability-corrected, wind- and canopy-dependent), and solves the tridiagonal heat-flow system via the Thomas algorithm. Volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity are derived from layer thickness, bulk density, texture (sand/silt/clay), organic carbon, rocks, and soil water. Outputs include daily min/mean/max temperatures for each layer and surface, and profiles of heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and heat storage.",
        "Short description": "Simulates soil and surface temperature dynamics over a layered soil profile using a finite-difference heat flow model with atmospheric boundary coupling.",
