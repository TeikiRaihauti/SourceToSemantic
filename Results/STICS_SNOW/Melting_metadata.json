        "Extended description": "Degree-day snowmelt component from the STICS framework. It computes daily snowmelt M (mm water equivalent per day) only when average air temperature exceeds a melt threshold Tmf. The melt factor K varies seasonally as K = DKmax/2 * (−sin(2π·jul/366 + 9π/16)) + Kmin + DKmax/2, with jul the day of year, DKmax the amplitude between maximum and minimum melt rates, and Kmin the minimum melt rate (at winter solstice). The melt rate is M = K · (tavg − Tmf) if tavg > Tmf, else 0.",
