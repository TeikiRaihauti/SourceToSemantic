        "Extended description": "Computes daily snow cover depth from snowfall accumulation, melt, and compaction. The model updates depth by adding the contribution of new snow (scaled by specified new-snow density), subtracting melt, and applying a linear compaction term proportional to previous-day snow depth. If melt exceeds available snow, depth is set to zero. Time step: daily.",
