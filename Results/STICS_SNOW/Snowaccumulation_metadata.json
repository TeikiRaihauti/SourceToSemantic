        "Extended description": "SnowAccumulation is a simple daily snowfall partitioning routine from the STICS model. It computes the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow (fs) based on maximum air temperature thresholds: if tmax is below tsmax, all precipitation is snow; if above trmax, all is rain; between tsmax and trmax, a linear interpolation determines fs. Snowfall accumulation (Snowaccu) is then fs multiplied by daily precipitation, expressed as water equivalent.",
