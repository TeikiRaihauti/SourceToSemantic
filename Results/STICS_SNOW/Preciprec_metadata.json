        "Extended description": "Daily routine that recalculates precipitation to close the snowpack mass balance. Starting from observed precipitation (precip), it adjusts for changes in snow water equivalent inferred from snow depth and density and for refreezing and snowfall. If total snow water (Sdry + Swet) is less than the previous day (Sdry_t1 + Swet_t1), a correction ((Sdepth_t1 - Sdepth) * rho) - Mrf is added; finally, snowfall accumulation (Snowaccu) is subtracted: preciprec = precip [+ correction if condition] - Snowaccu.",
