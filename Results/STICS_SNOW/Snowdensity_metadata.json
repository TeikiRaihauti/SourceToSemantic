        "Extended description": "Computes the bulk density of the snow cover (kg/m^3). If snow depth and total snow water equivalent are both greater than zero, density is calculated as (Sdry_t1 + Swet_t1) / Sdepth_t1, where Sdry_t1 and Swet_t1 are the solid and liquid water equivalents (mmW) and Sdepth_t1 is snow depth (m). Otherwise, the previous day's density ps_t1 is retained.",
        "Short description": "Bulk snowpack density from SWE and depth with fallback to previous value.",
