        "Extended description": "STICS SnowMelt component (v1.0) computes daily snowmelt as the ratio of meltwater rate (M, mm water per day) to snow density (ps, kg/m3), returning zero when density is near zero. It produces snowmelt in meters and is designed for a daily time step, following STICS model conventions.",
