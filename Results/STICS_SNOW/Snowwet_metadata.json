        "Extended description": "Computes the daily liquid water content in the snowpack (Swet). If refreezing (Mrf) does not exceed the previous day's liquid water (Swet_t1), a provisional value is calculated as Swet_t1 + precip − Snowaccu + M − Mrf, and then capped at 10% of the solid snow water content (0.1 × Sdry). If Mrf > Swet_t1, Swet is set to 0. The component represents a simple water balance with a structural limit on liquid retention in the snowpack.",
