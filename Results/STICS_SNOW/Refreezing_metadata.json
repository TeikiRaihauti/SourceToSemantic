        "Extended description": "Refreezing is a STICS snow-module submodel that estimates the daily amount of liquid water within the snowpack that refreezes when air temperature is below a melt threshold. It applies a degree-day formulation: the refreezing rate equals a temperature index (SWrf) times the difference between the melting threshold (Tmf) and the average temperature (tavg) when tavg < Tmf; otherwise refreezing is zero. Outputs are expressed as mm of liquid water per day.",
        "Short description": "Degree-day refreezing submodel for snow in STICS: Mrf = SWrf × (Tmf − tavg) when tavg < Tmf, else 0.",
