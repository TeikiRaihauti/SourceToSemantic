        "Extended description": "TempMax is a STICS component that recalculates daily maximum air temperature considering snow cover insulation. If snow depth (Sdepth_cm) exceeds a threshold (prof), the maximum temperature is constrained within [tminseuil, tmaxseuil]. If snow is present but shallower than prof and the original tmax is below or equal to 0°C, a linear insulation correction is applied: tmaxrec = tmaxseuil - ((1 - Sdepth_cm/prof) * (-tmax)); otherwise, tmaxrec is set to 0. When no snow is present, tmaxrec equals the input tmax. This implements snow-related moderation of extreme temperatures as used in the STICS model.",
