        "Extended description": "Daily snowpack solid water calculation. Updates Sdry (mm water equivalent) from the previous day's solid stock (Sdry_t1) by adding snowfall accumulation (Snowaccu) and refreezing of liquid water (Mrf) and subtracting melt (M). If melt does not exceed the previous solid stock (M ≤ Sdry_t1), then Sdry = max(0.001, Sdry_t1 + Snowaccu + Mrf − M); otherwise Sdry remains at 0. Time step: 1 day.",
