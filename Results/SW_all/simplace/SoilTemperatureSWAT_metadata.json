        "Extended description": "SoilTemperatureSWAT is a SIMPLACE/BioMA component that computes daily soil temperature for each soil layer using SWAT/EPIC-derived formulations. It updates layer temperatures with a first-order lag and a depth-dependent damping mechanism driven by bulk density, volumetric water content, soil profile depth, and layer thickness. The component computes maximum damping depth and effective damping depth based on water content scaling, derives a depth factor from the layer center relative to the damping depth, and blends the annual mean air temperature with the surface soil temperature weighted by the depth factor, applying a lag coefficient to account for thermal memory. Inputs include per-layer volumetric water content, bulk density, layer thickness, surface soil temperature, annual average air temperature, soil profile depth, and a lag coefficient; output is the per-layer soil temperature state.",
