        "Extended description": "Strategy for calculating soil temperature by layers using the SWAT method. The algorithm computes a water-content-dependent damping depth based on bulk density and total soil water, then updates each layerâ€™s temperature via a lagged approach that blends the annual average air temperature with the current surface soil temperature using a depth factor.
