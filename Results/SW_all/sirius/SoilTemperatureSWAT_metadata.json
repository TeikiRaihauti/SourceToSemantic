        "Extended description": "Implements the SWAT (Neitsch et al., 2000) soil temperature routine to compute daily soil temperature by layer. The method first estimates surface soil temperature from air temperature range, global solar radiation and albedo, and weights it with vegetation (above-ground biomass) and snow cover. Layer temperatures are then updated with a temporal lag coefficient and an exponential damping depth that depends on bulk density, total soil water content and soil profile depth. Inputs include layer thickness, bulk density, soil profile depth, annual mean air temperature, volumetric water content by layer, and surface soil temperature; output is soil temperature by layers.",
