        "Extended description": "Implements the SWAT method to compute soil temperature by layers with a daily time step. The approach uses layer thickness, bulk density, volumetric water content, and an annual average air temperature to compute maximum damping depth, a scaling factor, and depth factors, then applies a lagged update to each layerâ€™s temperature. The surface soil temperature is computed via the SWAT surface energy balance proxy and used with a lag coefficient to update the profile.
