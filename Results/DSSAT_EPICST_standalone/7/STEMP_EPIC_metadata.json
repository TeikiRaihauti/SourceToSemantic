        "Extended description": "Determines daily soil temperature by layer using the EPIC method of Potter & Williams (1994). The component computes a damping depth from soil bulk density and water content, accounts for surface cover from biomass/mulch or snow, and uses a wet-day fraction memory and a 5-day moving average driver to estimate surface temperature. Layer temperatures are updated each day by exponentially attenuating the surface signal with depth (with lag), producing surface litter temperature and temperatures for each soil layer. Designed to operate within DSSAT-like control/data structures.",
