        "Extended description": "Implements the EPIC soil temperature algorithm to compute daily soil temperatures by soil layer. The component uses soil physical properties (bulk density, layer thickness, depth), plant-extractable soil water, wet-day fraction from recent rainfall/irrigation, and surface cover effects from biomass, mulch, and snow to estimate surface temperature and propagate it into the profile using an exponential damping depth and a first-order lag update.",
        "Short description": "Determines soil temperature by layer",
