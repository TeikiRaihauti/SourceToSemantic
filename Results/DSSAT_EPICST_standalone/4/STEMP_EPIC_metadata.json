        "Extended description": "Daily soil temperature component computing layer temperatures using the EPIC method (Potter & Williams, 1994). It derives a surface temperature signal from air temperature, wet-day frequency, and surface cover (biomass/mulch and snow), estimates damping depth from bulk density and water status, and updates layer temperatures via an exponential depth response with a lag. Integrates with DSSAT-style soil, weather, and management data structures.",
        "Short description": "Determines daily soil temperature by layer using the EPIC method with water and cover effects.",
