        "Extended description": "STEMP_EPIC computes daily soil temperature by layer using the EPIC approach of Potter and Williams (1994), adapted for DSSAT. It derives a damping depth from soil bulk density (ABD) and water effects (DP = 1000 + 2500·FX, with FX = ABD/(ABD + 686·e^(−5.63·ABD)); WW = 0.356 − 0.144·ABD). Plant-available water modulates thermal damping via WC and FX. A 30‑day memory of wet days defines WFT, which, together with daily air temperatures (TMIN, TAVG, TMAX), forms a surface forcing term X2. Surface temperature combines meteorological forcing and surface cover (biomass/mulch or snow) using BCV to yield SRFTEMP. Layer temperatures are updated with a lag factor (0.5) and a depth response F = ZD/(ZD + e^(−0.8669 − 2.0775·ZD)), where ZD = DSMID/DD. The routine outputs daily surface and layer temperatures and is typically called at daily time steps within DSSAT.",
