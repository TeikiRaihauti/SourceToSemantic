        "Extended description": "STEMP_EPIC is a Fortran soil temperature component implementing the EPIC method to compute daily soil temperatures by layer. It derives a damping depth from soil bulk density and water status, uses a 30â€‘day memory of wet days (rain + irrigation) and a soil cover factor (from biomass, mulch, and snow) to adjust surface temperature drivers, and applies empirical relations from Potter & Williams (1994) to estimate an effective surface temperature. Layer temperatures are updated with an exponential damping function and a lag factor, producing daily surface and profile soil temperatures for use by other modules.",
