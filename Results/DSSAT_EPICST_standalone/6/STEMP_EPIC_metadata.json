        "Extended description": "Computes daily soil temperature by layer using the EPIC method of Potter & Williams (1994). The component updates surface and layer temperatures from air temperature (TAVG, TMAX, TMIN), soil properties (bulk density, layer depths, water limits), soil water and wet-day frequency, and surface cover from biomass, mulch, and snow. It runs within a DSSAT-style control loop and outputs SRFTEMP and ST for each soil layer.",
