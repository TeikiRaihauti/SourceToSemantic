        "Extended description": "Implements the EPIC soil temperature method to compute daily soil surface and layer temperatures. The component uses soil properties, water content, surface cover (biomass, mulch, snow), and daily weather to update a five-day moving average driver and applies depth-dependent damping to estimate temperatures by layer.",
        "Short description": "Determines daily soil temperature by layer using the EPIC method.",
