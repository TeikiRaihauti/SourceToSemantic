        "Extended description": "Implements the EPIC soil temperature routine to compute daily soil temperatures by soil layer. The component uses bulk density, layer thickness, cumulative depth, soil water (or drained upper limit), residue/mulch and snow cover, and a 30-day wet-day fraction to adjust temperature damping and surface temperature. It maintains a 5-day moving average driver (X2), applies cover effects, and updates surface and layer temperatures with a lag factor. Outputs include surface temperature and per-layer soil temperature.",
