        "Extended description": "Simulates diurnal soil heat flux and temperature profiles using a 1-D heat conduction scheme with a tri-diagonal solver (Thomas algorithm), mixed forward/backward differencing (ν), and coupling to the atmospheric boundary layer via Monin–Obukhov-based conductance. Thermal properties are computed from soil constituents (rocks, organic matter, sand, silt, clay, water, air) and mapped from layers to nodes; net radiation is partitioned into shortwave and longwave components and adjusted by albedo and canopy effects. Initialization and seasonal damping follow Campbell (1985).",
