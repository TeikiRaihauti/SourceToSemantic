        "Extended description": "SoilTemperature simulates soil surface and profile temperatures by solving one-dimensional heat conduction with variable thermal properties influenced by soil constituents (rocks, minerals, organic matter, air, water, ice) and water content. It computes net radiation (shortwave and longwave) and optionally estimates atmospheric boundary layer conductance, then advances temperatures using a tridiagonal (Thomas) solver with stability parameter nu. The profile is discretized into physical and phantom nodes, and constituent volumetric fractions determine thermal conductivity and volumetric specific heat. Daily air temperature is interpolated, and surface temperature is driven by radiation and albedo. The implementation follows concepts based on Campbell (1985).",
