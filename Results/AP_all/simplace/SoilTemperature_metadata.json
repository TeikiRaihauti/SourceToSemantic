        "Extended description": "A SIMPLACE component implementing an APSIM-Campbell style one-dimensional soil temperature model. It solves transient heat conduction in a soil profile with an energy balance at the surface, computing boundary layer conductance (optionally via an iterative Moninâ€“Obukhov approach), net radiation partitioning, and latent/sensible heat fluxes. The profile includes phantom nodes to a specified depth of constant temperature. Volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity are derived from layer constituents (rocks, organic matter, sand, silt, clay, water, air) and bulk density, with mapping between layer and node values. The model runs on internal sub-daily timesteps to produce daily minima, maxima, and averages of soil temperature per depth.",
