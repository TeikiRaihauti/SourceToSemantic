        "Extended description": "APSIM’s SoilTemperature component computes heat fluxes and soil temperature profiles using a 1D finite-difference scheme coupled to atmospheric boundary layer conductance and net radiation estimates. It accounts for soil physical properties (texture, bulk density, organic matter, rocks), water content, radiative and sensible/latent heat fluxes, and diurnal forcing. Based on Campbell (1985).",
        "Short description": "Heat flux and temperatures over the surface and soil profile (based on Campbell, 1985).",
