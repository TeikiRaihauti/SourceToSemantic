        "Extended description": "A soil temperature component implementing a multi-node one-dimensional heat diffusion model with atmospheric boundary coupling. The model discretizes the soil profile into nodes (including an aboveground air node, a surface node, soil nodes, and optional phantom nodes below the profile) and solves heat conduction using a tridiagonal Thomas algorithm per internal timestep. Thermal conductivity and volumetric specific heat are computed from constituent fractions (rocks, organic matter, sand, silt, clay, water, ice, air) and mapped from layers to nodes. The model supports calculation of net radiation and atmosphere boundary layer conductance (or using constants/inputs), accounts for diurnal air temperature variation, and initializes soil temperature either from provided initial values or an analytical seasonal solution attenuated with depth. The component exposes numerous parameters (e.g., layer thickness, bulk density, roughness, latent heat, Stefanâ€“Boltzmann constant) and weather/exogenous drivers (e.g., Min/Max/Mean T, Tav/Amp, wind, air pressure, radiation, canopy height, soil water) and provides outputs such as soil temperature profiles, daily min/max/average soil temperature, heat storage, thermal conductance/conductivity, and boundary layer conductance.",
