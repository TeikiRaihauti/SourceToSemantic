        "Extended description": "Calculates daily soil temperature profile by layer using the EPIC/Parton-Logan approach driven by annual mean temperature (TAV), amplitude (TAMP), daily weather (TAVG/TMAX, SRAD), soil albedo, bulk density, and water content. Produces layer temperatures and a soil surface temperature while maintaining a 5-day moving average.",
